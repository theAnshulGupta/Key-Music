# Key-Music
Press letters to make music! Using Paper.js and Howler.js, paired with HTML and CSS, pressing a key creates a bright sound and animation. Open the HTML file, press any letter on teh QWERTY keyboard, and enjoy the "magic". Note, the update names may be a little off since I misnamed a few.
